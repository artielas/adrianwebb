    <p>5-13-1804 - There is so much I dread to speak of... I understand that the public presumes me dead, yet I question how safe I am. I study cryptography and innovative methods of hiding my words, even if my location is not found. There is so much I would like to express, but I don't want anyone knowing of <i>this.</i></p>
    <p>5-8-1814 - It has been exactly ten years since my disappearance. I shan't reveal the aliases I have donned in this time, out of safety, but I am sometimes left considering what I would be like if I had stayed. I do hope my mother and father are well... It feels like an eternity has passed since I've been to my old university.</p>
    <p>1828 - Perhaps it is too early to jump to conclusions, but I look in the looking-glass and swear that it appears I haven't aged a day. I'm in my forties and yet I appear a decade younger. I know it cannot be health choices, as I've neglected that far too long in favour of my research, but... Is it this condition of mine?</p>
    <p>1846 - My nights are often sleepless still. The few I do sleep in, I find myself in reenacting waking nightmares, or the same regular nightmares. Often, I dream of awaking in the night, binding my chest, and noticing my reflection in the dim looking-glass, where my flesh rots and corrodes as I stare. Others, I dream of confronting my parents again, and discovering them as corpses. I confront my old colleagues, sometimes discussing my condition, and am dismissed as a madman. Is that simply all I am, a madman? Is there truly no "condition" of mine? Has it been a figment all these years? However, peering over my entries once more, my reflection has remained in haunting youth. I should be in my fifties or sixties, and I'm haunted by the young man I once was.</p>
