    <h2>Letter to Dr. Erwin French from Elias Lancaster - May 8th, 1804</h2>
    <p>Dear Dr. French,</p>
    <p>I'm afraid I may become unable to come directly to your office for the foreseeable future; however the condition I discussed with you is improving. Do not worry for me, for the next time I see you, should it come, I hope to be rid of it.</p>
    <p>If or when I should withdraw contact from my fellow-creatures, I ask that you conceal all artefacts you own that prove you know of this condition. You may send them to me if you truly do not want them destroyed; otherwise, I ask that if you can't hide them, then burn them. When I discover a way to cure myself of it, I wish that none speak of or suffer from it from then on.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Elias Lancaster</p>
