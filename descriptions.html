    <h2>Descriptions - <a href="https://eliaslancaster.netlify.app">Elias Lancaster</a></h2>
    <p>Lancaster was depicted by himself and others as an intelligent young adult with brown hair, brown eyes, and fair skin. However, the older he got, the more varied these descriptions got, with peers claiming that his eye color, hair color, or face shape abruptly changed on occasion before his disappearance.</p>
    <p>Lancaster often described himself as a "medical anomaly" with no clear elaboration on the subject. It's believed that this is a reference to his psychotic episodes that he describes in <a href="https://eliaslancaster.netlify.app/journals.html">his journals</a>.</p>
