    <h2>Adrian Webb</h2>
    <p>Adrian Webb was an English biologist in the 18th and 19th centuries, infamous for his rumored studies in alchemy and disappearance in his later life.</p>
    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>Webb was born in England in 1784, and moved throughout Europe in his lifetime. He was raised in a small English town before moving to London in 1798 at 14 years old.</p>
    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>Webb attended a university in [REDACTED], where he started pursuing a career in medicine. However, in his second year in 1804, he began skipping classes and denying visitors to his apartment, before being presumed missing after a month with no contact from him. When his apartment was searched, many sketches and letters from him were found, but Webb himself was never discovered.</p>
    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
    <p>Webb was known to have mental health struggles, especially with what is believed to be psychosis. As well as this, <a href="https://adrianwebb.netlify.com/journals.html">his journals</a> detailing his research are all encoded, likely to make it harder to access due to paranoia.</p>
    <h3>Modern Day</h3>
    <p>While improbable, there have been many sightings of men throughout Europe and North America that match <a href="https://adrianwebb.netlify.app/descriptions.html">the description and portrait sketches of Adrian Webb.</a></p>
