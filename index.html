  <h3>Early Life</h3>
  <p>Lancaster was born in England in 1784, and moved throughout Europe in his lifetime. He was raised in a small English town before moving to London in 1798 at 14 years old. Reports from staff of Lancaster's primary school all state that other children saw him as "sometimes appearing monstrous."</p>
  <h3>Career</h3>
  <p>Lancaster attended a university in [REDACTED], where he started pursuing a career in medicine. However, in his second year in 1804, he began skipping classes and denying visitors to his apartment, before being presumed missing after a month with no contact from him. When his apartment was searched, many sketches and letters from him and his psychologist were found, but Lancaster was never discovered.</p>
  <h3>Mental Health</h3>
