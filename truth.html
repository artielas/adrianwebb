<!-- If you're seeing this, then you got what I wanted you to see. I understand, it's leaking personal documents, but I'm concerned for the health of my colleague -- no, friend. I want to know they're OK, and that they haven't relived what I've read to get here. I'm afraid to continue digging, I don't want to hurt him... And I don't want to live the "mad scientist" trope of digging deeper than any living person should to find the truth. -->

    <p>5-13-1804 - There is so much I dread to speak of... I understand that the public presumes me dead, yet I question how safe I am. I study cryptography and innovative methods of hiding my words, even if my location is not found. There is so much I would like to express, but I don't want anyone knowing of <i>this.</i></p>
    <p>5-8-1814 - It has been exactly ten years since my disappearance. I shan't reveal the aliases I have donned in this time, out of safety, but I am sometimes left considering what I would be like if I had stayed. I do hope my mother and father are well... It feels like an eternity has passed since I've been to my old university.</p>
    <p>2-14-1828 - Perhaps it is too early to jump to conclusions, but I look in the looking-glass and swear that it appears I haven't aged a day. I'm in my forties and yet I appear a decade younger. I know it cannot be health choices, as I've neglected that far too long in favour of my research, but... Is it this condition of mine?</p>
    <p>11-4-1846 - My nights are often sleepless still. The few I do sleep in, I find myself reenacting waking nightmares, or repeating standard nightmares. Often, I dream of awaking in the night, binding my chest, and noticing my reflection in the dim looking-glass, where my flesh rots and corrodes as I stare. Others, I dream of confronting my parents again, and discovering them as corpses. I confront my old colleagues, sometimes discussing my condition, and am dismissed as a madman. Is that simply all I am, a madman? Is there truly no "condition" of mine? Has it been a figment all these years? However, peering over my entries once more, my reflection has remained in haunting youth. I should be in my fifties or sixties, and I'm haunted by the young man I once was.</p>
    <p>4-22-1872 - I often ponder what I would be like if I had not had this condition, if I had not wasted my life away peering into this condition. Maybe my childhood would have had more room for innocence, less knowledge that there is something wrong with the chemical makeup of my body. Or maybe I would have learned of it later than in youth. Possibly, it was an inevitability. Somedays, I wish I had noticed it later, and had not hid the symptoms until I reached adulthood. Others, I wish I had noticed it earlier, and alerted someone. Alas, the past is the past, and I cannot go back in time.</p>
    <p>3-05-1892 - I swore I would never inflict this on another living thing... Oh God, what have I done...</p>

    <p>9-23-2021 - WHY AM I STILL HERE? WHY AM I THE ONE THAT MUST PURSUE? ACCURSED CREATOR, IS THAT ALL MY PURPOSE IS? TO PERSEVERE WHEN I'VE LOST ALL TRACE OF WHO I ONCE WAS? THE ONE TIME I AM JOYOUS, I HAVE NO ONE FROM MY HISTORY TO SHARE IT WITH! IS THIS SOME CRUEL JOKE?</p>
